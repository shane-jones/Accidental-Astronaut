            Frank Holloway, a research Astrobiologist." 
            
    LOG "We searched but were unable to look any longer and left with diminishing air supplies.This ship was hit by debris from an
            asteroid and is in orbit around a planet called and that it can sustain life"
    
    LOG "Holloway, if you read this, needs to get there. Several problems exist though. This ship can't be flown to the surface without 
         being destroyed passing through the atmosphere  as itâ€™s a freighter and not capable of landing on a planet and would burn up 
         entering the atmosphere"
    
    LOG "Additionally, the ship is not very stable in the current orbit due to the explosion and is slowly drifting towards the planet. 
         There is a one shuttle left in the cargo bay. The ship is unpressurised the hull must be repaired and then possibly attempt to 
         stabilise the ship from the bridge to buy more time."

    HANC "I am analysing the situation now"
    HANC "I will attempt to power up and pressurise the rest of the ship"
    PC "...*minutes later...*"
    HANC "I can't get enough power to run the ship properly until it can be sealed"
    HANC "You will need to go outside, better you than me"
    HANC "The ship has no oxygen due to a hole in the hull which must be repaired."
    HANC "After the collision, a crew member attempted to repair the hole but was lost after being hit by a small debris field"
    HANC "The crew could not pressurise the ship and therefore only had the oxygen in their suits. They were forced to abandon
          the ship but could not locate you and ran out of time"
    HANC "They took one of the two shuttles and left. They fired the engines away from the mothership but something happened and they
          never made it to the surface below"
    HANC "They did not make radio contact with anyone so there will be no help, at this point."
    HANC "The illustrious is still orbiting the planet Orta which is a trading partner. Its populated with people that are civilised
          but still not capable of spaceflight"
    HANC "The atmosphere is suitable and there is plenty of food and water. They are friendly and helpful"
